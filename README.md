## How It Works

WaniTrack is a **Progressive Web App** that connects directly to the WaniKani API. All data processing happens locally in your browser using IndexedDB for storage.

**Your data never touches a server**—everything stays on your device.

### Privacy & Security
- ✅ Direct connection to WaniKani API only
- ✅ No intermediary servers
- ✅ No analytics or tracking
- ✅ API token stored locally in your browser
- ✅ All calculations performed client-side

**Recommendation:** Use a read-only API token (write permissions not needed).
